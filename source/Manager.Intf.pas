  Unit: Manager.Intf

  Purpose:
    Defines the set of core interfaces for orchestration, presentation, and management of interactions
    within the File2knowledgeAI architecture. This unit centralizes the contracts for persistence,
    display, prompt management, and advanced handling of resources associated with the
    OpenAI v1/responses endpoint.

  Architecture and Design:
    - Groups interfaces governing prompt editing, conversational display (chat UI, reasoning),
      asynchronous operation management, file and vector handling via OpenAI, as well as
      persistence and navigation of conversation history.
    - Applies OpenAI/GenAI best practices regarding traceability, UI/business logic decoupling,
      reactive programming patterns (Promises), and modularity for scalable robustness.
    - Centralizes domain contracts essential for conversation chaining,
      state tracking (via ResponseId tracking), and comprehensive resource lifecycle control,
      ensuring tight orchestration around the v1/responses workflow.

  Usage:
    - Implement these interfaces to inject services and controllers into the main application (IoC/DI).
    - Enables agile asynchronous flows (prompts, reasoning, file management),
      aligned with the robustness and maintainability requirements of modern GenAI solutions.

  Context:
    This unit is at the core of File2knowledgeAI, ensuring compliance with best practices
    for prompt chaining, advanced vector resource management, and integration
    with the OpenAI v1/responses endpoint. Essential for building traceable,
    persistent, and easily testable conversational applications.

  Conventions follow the File2knowledgeAI project and OpenAI v1/responses standards.
