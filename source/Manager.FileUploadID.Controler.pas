(*
  Unit: Manager.FileUploadID.Controler

  Purpose:
    Acts as the central manager for all file-to-FileUploadId mappings in the File2knowledgeAI application, coordinating
    UI actions and business logic with persistent vector resource data and server APIs.

  Key roles and responsibilities:
    - Orchestrates the life cycle of file attachments: adding, deleting, and validating synchronization between
      UI state, client-side drafts, and OpenAI-managed vector stores.
    - Maintains reliable “snapshot” and “draft” dictionaries, enabling transactional updates, rollback, and consistency checks.
    - Provides a single point of coordination between the UI.VectorResourceEditor.VCL and lower-level helper
      units for file and dictionary operations.

  Project context:
    - Designed for integration with Helper.FileUploadID.Dictionary and the main vector resource editor UI, ensuring
      maintainability and transparency during prototyping and demos.
    - Clearly documented and organized to support direct onboarding of developers at any level, with clear upgrade paths for
      scaling to more advanced enterprise needs (transaction management, async operations, etc.).
    - Easily extendable for further functionalities such as multi-user synchronization, batch operations, or enhanced
      error handling.
