  Unit: CancellationButton.VCL

  Purpose:
    This unit implements a simple, reusable VCL component for managing "cancellation" actions in user interfaces.
    The class TCancellationVCL wraps a TButton, providing mechanisms to detect, reset, and visually signal
    a cancellation request (e.g., to halt long-running or background operations).
    It supports toggling between normal and cancellation states, making it easy to add cancellation logic
    to any interactive workflow.

  Technical details:
    - TCancellationVCL implements ICancellation for standardized cancellation detection and signaling.
    - Manages button text and event handler swapping to represent normal vs cancellation states.
    - Stores and restores the original button caption and OnClick event to ensure seamless UI integration.
    - Uses a custom "cancel" glyph (Unicode character) for visual feedback in cancellation mode.
    - The Reset method initializes the cancellation state and prepares the button for use; Cancel
      returns the button to its original state.
    - Tracks the cancellation state via the FCancelled property, accessible via IsCancelled.

  Dependencies:
    - Delphi VCL TButton for user interaction.
    - UI.Styles.VCL for consistent button styling across the application.
    - Manager.Intf for interface-based interaction with broader application components.
    - Standard System.Classes and Controls for event and type definitions.

  Quick start for developers:
    - Instantiate TCancellationVCL, passing a TButton to its constructor.
    - Call Reset to switch the button into cancellation mode; the button will now display a "cancel" icon
      and respond to clicks by invoking Cancel.
    - Use IsCancelled to check from your workflow logic whether cancellation was requested.
    - When finished or aborting, call Cancel to restore the button to its original caption and behavior.

  This unit is intended for easy drop-in cancellation support in Delphi VCL applications,
  promoting clarity, user feedback, and minimal code coupling for cancellation functionality.
